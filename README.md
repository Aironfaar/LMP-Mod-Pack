How to install:

**Dependencies**:
 - **LMP - ModdedPBSLoader**: depends on **LMP - ModdedPokemonGraphicsLoader** (not exactly, but the game WILL crash without it)

 - **LMP - FastHatch:** Skips the animation when hatching eggs, if **AMB - AddOpt** is installed it adds a toggle in the menu.
 - **LMP - ModdedPBSLoader:** Loads Pokémon, abilities and moves from Mods folder at runtime, does absolutely nothing on its own.
 - **LMP - ModdedPokemonGraphicsLoader:** Loads Pókemon graphics from Mods folder at runtime, does nothing on its own.
 - **LMP - ExampleMod:** Using ModdedPBSLoader and ModdedPokemonGraphicsLoader, implements a few pokemon as an example on how to make a mod using this framework.
