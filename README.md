 - **LMP - ModdedPBSLoader:** Loads Pokémon, abilities and moves from Mods folder at runtime, does absolutely nothing on its own.
 - **LMP - ModdedPokemonGraphicsLoader:** Loads Pókemon graphics from Mods folder at runtime, does nothing on its own.
 - **LMP - CreateAllFields:** Allows most fields to be created with a move, like Misty Terrain. These moves are signature moves of otherwise subpar Pokémon. (See list in wiki)
